  <h4>Neophron the poet</h4>
  <p>The corner apartment is located in a modernist residential condominium building on Neofronos Street.
    The name of the street borrows from one of the most prolific ancient greek dramatists, Neophron of Sicyon.
    Most notably, Neophron is thought to be the originator of the Medea story,
     which in turn Euripides allegedly used to develop his infamous tragedy.</p>
